## Game Of Life
Implementation of Conway's "Game Of Life".
>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

It receives an image in .bmp format (from CLI) and outputs the whole cycle of the game (a bunch of iterations in .bmp images) in the specified folder. Below are shown some of __examples__ of how it works:

## Archiver
Implementation of the basic Archiver and the ArciverRLE using RLE encoding.

## Rubik's Cube Solver
This program can solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube from any combination with basic algorithm _"White cross"_
